# Analysis of aggregation kinetic data

## What is this notebook for?

This jupyter notebook serves as a template for fast analysis and plotting of aggregation kinetic data. The aim is to provide a tool that can be used to analysise kinetic data files obtained from FLUOstar Omega plate readers (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). This will provide faster and more efficient data handling and produce publication ready quality figures.

*This document will presumably serve as a supplementary document to a future paper (experimental details will not be included for those reasons)*

## To get started

In order to being able to use this notebook you will need to do the following steps:

1. Install Anaconda3 or miniconda3 in order to install the Jupyter Notebook. (miniconda is smaller)


2. Download the repository from GitHub


3. Navigate to the folder you downloaded from Github


4. Create environment:

    - There is a file in the folder called tinna_environment.yml. It contains the required packages.
    - create an environment by writing this command in the terminal:
    
    ```.py
    conda env create -f tinna_environment.yml
    ```

5. Activate the environment by the following command:
    ```.py
    source activate project_env
    ```

6. Run Jupyter Notebook. Go into terminal, place yourself in directory where you see the folder that you downloaded from github. Write the following into the terminal:
